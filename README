=== ABOUT ===

This project contains application templates for use when generating
applications using Rails 3. The code was originally derived from Ryan Bates'
Railscast #148[0] (which I heartily recommend for an introduction to
application templates).

=== USAGE ===

$ rails new APP_NAME -T -J -m main.rb [-d {postgresql,mysql,...}]

(The template builds applications which use RSpec and jQuery instead of
Test::Unit and Prototype. For this reason, I recommend using the -T and
-J options when generating the application as shown above. This omits the
files normally created for those two packages.)
