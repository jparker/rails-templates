=== ABOUT ===

This project contains application templates for use when generating
applications using Rails 3. The code was originally derived from Ryan Bates'
Railscast #148[0] (which I heartily recommend for an introduction to
application templates).

=== USAGE ===

$ rails new APP_NAME -T -m main.rb [-d {postgresql,mysql,...}]

(The template builds applications which use RSpec instead of Test::Unit.
For this reason, I recommend using the -T options when generating the
application as shown above. This omits the files normally created for
Test::Unit.)
