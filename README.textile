This project contains application templates for use when generating applications using Rails 2.3 or higher. E.g.,

<pre>
<code>
  $ rails APP_NAME -m http://github.com/jparker/rails-templates/raw/master/base.rb
</code>
</pre>

The layout was copied almost verbatim from Ryan Bates' "Railscast #148":http://railscasts.com/148 (which I heartily recommend for an introduction to application templates).
